# Instructions:
- Download and extract the latest release of "[CASCExplorer](https://github.com/WoW-Tools/CASCExplorer/releases)"
- Download `BlizzardSoundRipper`
- Run `install.py` and wait for it to complete the install

# Using CASCExplorer
- Run `CASCExplorer.exe`, then:
 * File
 * Open online storage
 * Select the game, for this example we'll use Diablo 4 (Retail)
 * Wait
 * Select the first CDN build
 * Wait

- Once it finishes loading, select any of the folders from the folder list. We'll select `"Base"` for this example. Expanding any folder in `"Base"` will show a list that usually contains a `"WwiseSoundBank"` folder. Select one of those, go to the file list and select all of the files, right click and extract all to the input folder

Once your input folder is populated, run the `"wsb-to-wav.py"` and wait! Once it finishes, your output folder should be entirely populated with WAV files!
